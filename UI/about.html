        <h2>How Politico was built</h2>
        <p>Politico was built by current lead Machine learning engineer at Google mr. Okoth Peter. In no time, this little
            project which was done as an entrace challenge for software engineers at African startup callend Andela soon became
            the most trusted election system. At the time of building this system, Okoth Peter was a mere Mathematics and Economisc
            student in a little known Murang'a University of Technology and had never tried his hand in Tech before.Enough for now, 
            if you need to know more about him,head over to his homepage.
        </p>
        <h2>How secure is Politico</h2>
        <p>There are two guiding principles when it comes to software design philosophy: Make it so complex that nibody 
            can really detect the flaw within, or make it so simple that there are no obvious flaw within.Politico was built 
            in Python programming language and is now managed by team of great software engineers.However, Okoth Peter still maintains the 
            legal rights and authority to direct it's progress as well as veto power to revert any changes that seems colloiqual.
        </p>
        <p>With regard to security, Politico is designed to act as a final answer or fail-proof desing towards progress of 
            interity. We use the latest encryption designs, cryptography and all measures of new securities that come in hand to
            keep of the entire voting system from the reach of even the best and most brilliant of all hackers. Although revealing all
            the particulars of our security system will be a great mess owing to sensitivity of the electoal system, be rest assured that
            everything is good in our hands. All the results are as well open to public scruitiny and for that, you can view and verify them 
            as they come in
